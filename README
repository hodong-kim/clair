Clair - A Low-Level POSIX/C System Library for Ada
==================================================

Clair is a library that provides safe, portable, and idiomatic Ada bindings
for common low-level POSIX/C system interfaces.
The primary goal is to abstract away platform-specific details and unsafe
C constructs, offering a robust foundation for systems programming in Ada.

***
### Current Status: Development in Progress
This library is currently **under active development**. The API may change
before the 1.0 release. Users should be aware of potential breaking changes.
***

Features
--------
* Safe Wrappers: Provides type-safe Ada interfaces for POSIX and C library functions.
* Modular Design: Includes modules for File I/O, Process Management,
  Signal Handling, Dynamic Library Loading, Error Management, and POSIX Types.
* Automatic Spec Generation: Uses tools to generate Ada specifications
  directly from system headers, ensuring correctness and portability.
* Rich Error Handling: Maps system `errno` values to a comprehensive
  set of distinct Ada exceptions for precise error handling.
* Simple Build System: Uses a Rakefile for easy compilation and testing.

Requirements
------------
* GNAT (The GNAT Ada Compiler)
* GCC (The GNU C Compiler)
* AR (The GNU Archiver)
* Ruby (for the build system)
* POSIX-compliant system headers.

Building the Library
--------------------
The build process is managed by a Rakefile. The first time you run it,
it will automatically detect and cache the paths to the required tools
(gnatmake, gcc, ar).

To build both the static and shared libraries:
    $ rake

This will create `build/libclair.a` and `build/libclair.so`.

To build and run the test suite:
    $ rake tests
    $ rake test_process

To clean up build artifacts and the cached tool configuration:
    $ rake clean

Usage
-----
To use Clair in your project:
1. Add the `src` directory of the Clair library to your compiler's search
   path (e.g., using the `-I` flag with `gnatmake`).
2. Link your application with either the static (`libclair.a`) or shared
   (`libclair.so`) library.
3. `with` the required Clair packages in your Ada source code, for
   example: `with Clair.File;` or `with Clair.DL;`.

Library Modules
---------------
* Clair.Error: Manages POSIX `errno` and maps them to Ada exceptions.
* Clair.File: Provides file descriptor operations (`open`, `close`,
  `read`, `write`, `pipe`).
* Clair.Process: Handles process control (`fork`, `get_pid`, `exit`).
* Clair.Signal: Manages POSIX signals (`sigaction`, `raise`, `pause`).
* Clair.DL: Wraps dynamic library loading functions (`dlopen`, `dlsym`).
* Clair.Types: Defines portable POSIX types like `pid_t` and `mode_t`.

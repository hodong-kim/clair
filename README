===============================================================================

[ IMPORTANT NOTICE: EXPERIMENTAL VERSION ]

This software is currently in an experimental stage. The APIs, internal
structures, and implementation details are subject to change without prior
notice. It is not yet recommended for use in critical production environments.

===============================================================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Clair is a system programming library for the Ada programming language,
focusing on providing type-safe and efficient abstractions for low-level
operating system facilities.

Key features include:
  - Event Loop (currently based on kqueue for BSD/macOS)
  - Signal Handling (RAII-based signal masking and handling)
  - Time and Timer management
  - Non-blocking I/O primitives

BUILDING
--------
This project uses GNAT Project files (.gpr).
To build the library, ensure you have a GNAT compiler installed and run:

    gprbuild -P clair.gpr

PLATFORM SUPPORT
----------------
Current implementation heavily relies on 'kqueue', limiting support primarily
to BSD derivatives (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD) and macOS (Darwin).
Linux support (via epoll/signalfd) is planned for future releases.

COMMERCIAL SUPPORT
------------------
Professional support is available for enterprises and commercial projects.
Services include:
  - Integration assistance with legacy C/C++ or Ada systems
  - Custom feature development and platform porting
  - Priority bug fixes and technical consulting
